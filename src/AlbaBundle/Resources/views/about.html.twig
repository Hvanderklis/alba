                    <p>Welcome to our website which is to become our Bed & Breakfast booking site.</p>
                    <p>For quite some years we have been visiting Scotland and in 2014 we decided to move to Scotland and start our own Bed & Breakfast.</p>
                    <p>Weâ€™ve made plans already, but because of our mortgage we have to stay a few more years in the Netherlands.
                        The date is set to the first of september 2020!</p>
                    <p>On this website, we will keep you updated with our progress, difficulties and plans we come up with.
                        Thank you for being a part in our adventure!<br>
                        Anne Jan & Siebette</p>
